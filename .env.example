# Container Configuration
# Unique container name for this project instance
CONTAINER_NAME=python-dev-container

# Volume Mount Configuration
# IMPORTANT: Set this to your actual work directory, NOT the parent of this template
# Examples:
# HOST_WORK_DIR=/Users/yourusername/projects     # Absolute path to your projects
# HOST_WORK_DIR=~/work                          # Your work directory
# HOST_WORK_DIR=.                               # Current directory (only if this template is IN your project)
HOST_WORK_DIR=~/work

# SSH Configuration
# Port to expose SSH service on the host machine
SSH_PORT=2222

# SSH user credentials for container access
SSH_USER=developer
SSH_PASSWORD=dev123456

# Optional SSH Key Mounting (uncomment and add to docker-compose.yml volumes if needed):
# Add this line to volumes section: - ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh:ro

# Python Environment Variables
# Note: PYTHONPATH is intentionally NOT set to avoid conflicts with virtual environments
# This allows each project to manage its own Python environment independently
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1  # Prevents Python from writing .pyc files
PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1         # Ensures Python output is not buffered

# Virtual Environment Best Practices:
# - Use "python -m venv .venv" or "uv venv" in your project directory
# - Activate with "source .venv/bin/activate"
# - Each project maintains its own isolated Python environment

# Optional: Advanced environment variables (usually not needed)
# LANG=C.UTF-8
# LC_ALL=C.UTF-8
# TERM=xterm-256color
